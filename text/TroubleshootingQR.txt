'Format Link' button doesnt do anything:

 This feature decode URLs with ' % ' symbol in it, so it will be readable.
 If the url contains only readable signs, then it won't do anything.
 If the url starts with "https://diez.co.il/product/" - then it will take whatever comes after that and use it as the name of the file.

There was an issue generating the QR:

 Please make sure that you have a valid link, directory and file name.
 Don't use any special symbols such as: !, @, #, $, %, etc. in the file name.

QR was created successfully but I can't find it:

 Please make sure that the directory exists.
 Try to change to another directory.

I have an issue that could not be solved here:
